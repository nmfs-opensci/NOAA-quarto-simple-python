title: "NOAA quarto simple Python"
subtitle: "A simple Quarto webpage with a book layout with Python code in qmd or Jupyter Notebooks"
page-layout: full
---

This is a template for a simple Quarto website that looks like a "book". This is a common format for documentation. It includes a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAA-quarto-simple-python/blob/main/.github/workflows/render-and-publish.yml) that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to `theme.scss`. The webpage will be on the `gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch. 

This Quarto website has Python code in the `code.qmd` file and has a Jupyter notebook. The GitHub Action will render those for you but note that you need some a special **RAW** block at the top of your ipynb file. Without this, the Jupyter notebook won't render (code blocks won't be computed). It looks like this
```
---
title: Jupyter Notebook
execute:
  enabled: true
jupyter: python3
---
```
Also you will need to add any modules that your code needs to the `requirements.txt` file so they are installed by the GitHub Action.

## GitHub Set-up

* Click the green "use template" button to make a repository with this content.  Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch).

* Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the  Settings > Pages page to find the url.
