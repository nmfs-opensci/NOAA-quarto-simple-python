title: Rendering with Code
---

You can have code Python in your qmd file. You will need to have these installed on your local computer, but presumably you do already if you are adding code to your qmd files.

```{python echo=TRUE}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
```

## Polar Axis

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig.cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Modify the GitHub Action

When you add Python modules, you will need to change the GitHub Action in `.github/workflows` to install these in order for GitHub to be able to render your webpage. The GitHub Action installs Python since I used that in `code.qmd`. If you use R or Julia instead, then you will need to update the GitHub Action to install those.

If getting the GitHub Action to work is too much hassle (and that definitely happens), you can alway render locally and publish to the `gh-pages` branch. If you do this, make sure to delete or rename the GitHub Action to something like
```
render-and-publish.old_yml
```
so GitHub does not keep trying to run it. Nothing bad will happen if you don't do this, but if you are not using the action (because it keeps failing), then you don't need GitHub to run it.

## Render locally and publish to gh-pages branch

To render locally and push up to the `gh-pages` branch, open a terminal window and then `cd` to the directory with the Quarto project. Type this in the terminal:
```
quarto render gh-pages
```
